I've been a "cosplayer" for about 10 years now.  It all started when my grandmother taught me how to sew.  I've always loved video games for as long as I can remember and it was amazing to be able to live even a small part of being some of the characters I loved.

Making a cosplay takes a lot of time and effort.  Planning out how you're going to make or sew certain pieces can take majority of the creating process, and in that way it's similar to working on a project.

For sewing, you get the skills of learning how to piece each pattern together and how to design them so they fit perfectly.  It also takes a long time to perfect certain techniques.

I hope to be able to share more details and progress pictures of a future cosplay.
