summary: I'm running as a queen contestant for this year's cherry blossom festival.
---

The  Cherry Blossom Festival is a cultural event that shares Japanese culture in Hawaii.  It is run  by the HJJCC and every year they hold a contest for girls to be able to be part of the court as princesses or even crowned queen.  They do not call it a pageant because they want to focus more on the cultural aspects.

Through this event I've been able to experience amazing cultural classes such as ramen making and taiko lessons.  The coordination for some of the events takes team work, such as when we learned to do Okinawan lion dancing.

This experience also teaches us public speaking skills.  Through this event, we have public appearences where we are brough on stage in a mall and given an impromptu question.
