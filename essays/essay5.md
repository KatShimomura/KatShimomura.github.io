## Back in My Day...

  What was your first intro to HTML?  Was it tumblr, or maybe a college course?  Well, this might give away how old I am, but back in my day--before Facebook--there was something called MySpace.  One of the begining "blog" type websites where you could update statuses, keep a list of friends, upload pictures, and most importantly (to me anyway) customize how your page looks.  Back then it was mostly copying and pasting other people's codes, but after a while you kind of got the hang of what code snippet did what, and you could go in and customize things yourself if you knew how to.  After the premier of Facebook and other social medias, MySpace died down, and everything I had learned about HTML got pushed into the back of my brain shelves, never to be seen again... Until now.
  
## Dusting off the Cobwebs
  A course I'm taking in college right now has required me to find that old HTML box in the back of my brain and dust it off, only to find that the contents inside are, well, basically nothing.  I remembered spending hours customizing my MySpace page, but I did't remember any syntax or how I did it!  I guess that's what happens when you don't use knowledge for over 10 years.  Luckily, this college course started from scratch and as we covered the basics of raw HTML and CSS, a few things started coming back to me.  Things like color codes, or putting images in were all similar to what I remember.  But a lot of things were new and different.  In MySpace, we didn't really have to worry about formatting because basic formatting was given to us, and I definitely don't remember there being any CSS.  The more we learned, the more web design became intimidating.  Surely, one would have to be a wizard at HTML and CSS to build any kind of decent looking web page!
