## Beginning with Art

  Like many children, when I was young one of the class subjects I enjoyed the most was art.  I loved all kinds of art, any media my parents or teachers would let me get my hands on I would try and love, from drawing or painting to scuplting with air dry clay.  I also loved video games as a child!  Ever since I could remember, my siblings and I would spend hours a day playing games with eachother.  When I got older my grandmother taught me how to sew, and it was just like any other art I'd tried; I loved it almost instantly.  But I had a lot to learn.  It was difficult, and much less forgiving than other forms of art I'd tried, but I would spend hours sewing and recreating outfits from my beloved video games and more.  Little did I know that this love for art and games would help lead me to choose the career path I've chosen today.

## Artistic Design Opportunities in Technology
  When I took my first electrical engineering electives the coding intimidated me, but the circuits interested me.  The first thing I thought was I could use these skills to light up a prop, and that's how I started in the field of engineering.  Though I did end up using those skills in a couple of props, things have changed since then.  I'm still interested in creating designs, but the design of software engineering intrigues me as well.  Although I still find coding to be pretty scary, I now see that there is an art to coding, and one day I hope to be able to think like a programmer and write code efficiently.

  This semester is the my first time learning and using Java Script, or any scripting language.  Right now I feel like I'm behind as far as learning the syntax, but I'm going to try to push forward and survive the course.  I hope to take these learning experiences and struggles to get closer to the goal of being proficient at coding.
