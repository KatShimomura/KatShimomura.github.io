Like many children, when I was young one of the class subjects I enjoyed the most was art.  I took up drawing and painting at home as well as playing video games.  When I got older my grandmother taught me how to sew, and from there my art grew into recreating outfits from my beloved video games and more.  Little did I know that this love for art and games would help lead me to choose the career path I've chosen today.

When I took my first electrical engineering electives the coding intimidated me, but the circuits interested me.  The first thing I thought was I could use these skills to light up a prop, and that's how I started in the field of engineering.  Things have changed since then.  I'm still interested in creating designs, but the design of software engineering intrigues me as well, and one day I hope to be able to think like a programmer and write code efficiently.

This semester is the my first time learning and using Java Script, or any scripting language.  Right now I feel like I'm behind as far as learning the syntax, but I'm going to try to push forward and survive the course.  I hope to take these learning experiences and struggles to get closer to the goal of being proficient at coding.
